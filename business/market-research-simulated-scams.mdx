## 4. Existing Solutions and Limitations

### Regulation & Government Action

#### FTC Rule on Business/Government Impersonation
- **Introduced in 2024**, allowing shutdown of fake websites
- **Fines up to $53,000 per incident** for violations
- **Enforcement mechanisms** for domain takedowns

#### National Elder Fraud Coordination Center

**Limitation:** Reactive enforcement and legal remedies; lack of real-time educational intervention for consumers.

### Enterprise-Level Tools

#### Brand Protection Tools (e.g., Bolster, BrandShield)
- **Focus on detecting** fraudulent domains and social accounts
- **Primarily reactive approach** to threat detection
- **Limited customer education** components

#### Internal Phishing Simulators (e.g., KnowBe4, Microsoft Defender)
- **Train employees only**; no reach to consumers

**Limitation:** None proactively "simulate scams to educate customers," missing the chance to stop errors in real scam-like contexts.

### Public Education

#### FTC, Better Business Bureau

- **Provide educational resources** and awareness campaigns
- **Static information** delivery methods

#### Industry Associations
- **Sector-specific warnings** (banking, retail, etc.)
